# PC-Management
This program can do:
1. Can set in how many minutes will your PC be turned off
2. Can set in how many minutes will your PC be turned into hibernation
3. Cancel set timing for 1. or 2.
4. Update your programs in the same cmd window
5. Update your programs in new cmd window
6. Exit program

I suggest you to start the program as an administrator so every avaible update can update its version without your knowledge

If you name this program any other name, you must update the name in programs notepad (:exit) for 6. to close the wanted program
